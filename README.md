# the_password_game_calculator
The rules of The Password Game from Nightmare Class were driving me crazy, so I wrote a calculator to free myself from the overwhelming calculations while still keeping the fun of the game!

link of the game [click](https://neal.fun/password-game/)

This calculator is specifically designed for rules 5, 9, and 18.
Rule 5 : sum of digits in the string
Rule 9 : product of roman numerals in the string
Rule 18 : sum of atomic numbers in the string

It's just a project for fun, so if there are any copyright issues, please feel free to let me know!
